# Statistics With R

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises of
[Geocomputation With R: 2nd
edition](https://www.amazon.com/Geocomputation-Chapman-Hall-Robin-Lovelace/dp/1032248882/)
by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, and Jannes Muenchow.

WATCH OUT: This is my personal learning material and is therefore
neither an accurate replication nor an authoritative textbook.

I wrote this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to
become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.
Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a
learner.
